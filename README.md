## 🔥 What Was EX0Sec OS?

EX0Sec OS was an experimental, security-themed operating system concept featuring:

- 🛡️ A realistic bootloader simulation  
- 🌐 A custom search engine ("TCHC Search") with anti-tracking principles  
- 🎨 Theme selection, including dark and crimson red aesthetics  
- 👨‍💻 A developer panel for coding and submitting websites  
- 🧠 An admin-only dashboard for approving and updating content  
- 🎵 Boot music integration ("Sweater Weather" instrumental)

The goal was to build a hybrid OS prototype inspired by BlackArch and Kali Linux, with a unique hacker-styled GUI and customizable interface.

## 💡 Why It Was Discontinued

Due to the project's scale and limitations of solo development (without team or funding), the decision was made to discontinue full production. However, the concepts, interfaces, and core components are made publicly available here.
